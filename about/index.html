         <h1>About me</h1>
         <p>I have had a quite broad experience in film production. While studying film at university I had the opportunity to gain understanding and practical experience in many different roles within a film production team. I completed courses in editing, script writing, production, actor direction, cinematography, TV production and more while maintaining a 5.69 GPA .</p>

<p>In my 4 years of working in film production companies and the internal production studio at 72andSunny Amsterdam, I have furthered my experience of various roles in a production team. The majority of that experience was as a producer, studio coordinator and editor.</p>

<p>I have the skills required to produce, shoot and edit online video content from concept to delivery as well as basic static and motion design skills. I have experience in producing for a variety of video types such as, corporate interviews, vox pops, BTS videos, social media product videos and GIFs. I have experience and feel confident editing in Adobe Premiere Pro and Avid Media Composer and have some basic experience with Adobe After Effects and Adobe Audition. I have experience shooting with blackmagic, canon dslrs and canon c300 cameras. Please see links below for examples of my editing and videography work.</p>

<p>While not having extensive professional experience with static design, I do have a practical understanding of the Photoshop, Illustrator and Indesign. I have worked on designs, assisting senior designers on projects that I was producing and/or coordinating through the studio. I am very keen to expand my capabilities in this area and it is something that I have been exploring in my freetime.</p>

<p>I also have experience producing and post producing projects with larger teams involving managing shooting days, sourcing and hiring freelance crews, budgeting and scheduling and supervising post-production in house and with external finishing houses and sound studios.
In addition I coordinated a busy video post production and design studio. The studio manager and I managed multiple concurrent projects as well as hired and managed specialised freelance talent and oversaw the dry hire and smooth operation of our facilities for main campaign spots. Please see links below for projects that I have produced.</p>
